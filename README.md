#APRIORI ALGORITHM
Apriori algorithm refers to the algorithm which is used to calculate the association rules between objects. It means how two or more objects are related to one another. In other words, we can say that the apriori algorithm is an association rule leaning that analyzes that people who bought product A also bought product B.

#Apriori Principle
If an itemset is infrequent, then all of its supersets must also be infrequent

#Advantages of Apriori Algorithm
It is used to calculate large itemsets.
Simple to understand and apply.

#For the given dataset 
Final Frequent Set :
[('p', 'q', 't', 'u'), ('r', 's', 't', 'u')]
Here, the minimum support given is 60% (given as input) 
It can be changed as per the requirements.
